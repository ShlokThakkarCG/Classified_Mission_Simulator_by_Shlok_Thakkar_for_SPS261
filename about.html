                        <p><strong>Classified Mission Simulator</strong> is an interactive educational tool designed for a university project in course SPS261 - Government Secrecy and Intelligence Studies. It translates complex strategic trade-offs into an interactive framework, enabling users to experience the decision-making pressures that define contemporary space governance.</p>

                        <p>This simulation is not an arbitrary game; its design is directly derived from the foundational academic papers provided for this university project. The ten-mission structure and four-metric evaluation system operationalize these theories into a playable simulation, translating academic models into experiential learning.</p>
                        <p>The core logic of the simulation is built by synthesizing two key works:</p>

                        <p>The simulation is built on a framework of competing strategic priorities. Each decision forces the user to weigh the costs and benefits associated with secrecy, security, diplomacy, and public perception.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-300 mt-6 mb-3">1. The Vaynman & Volpe "Dead Zone"</h3>
                        <p><em>Vaynman & Volpe (2023)</em> argue that cooperation on technology is determined by two factors: <strong>distinguishability</strong> (can you tell civilian and military uses apart?) and <strong>integration</strong> (is the tech embedded in both sectors?).</p>
                        <p>This simulation is set in what they term the "dead zone" of cooperation: assets that are both <strong>indistinguishable</strong> and <strong>highly integrated</strong>. Space systems, like AI and cyber, fit this perfectly. A satellite's sensor array can be used for climate science (civilian) or for targeting (military), and the ground stations are integrated with both civilian and military networks. This is the core problem: deception is easy, and verification is nearly impossible without risking espionage.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-300 mt-6 mb-3">2. Zagare's Game-Theoretic Modeling</h3>
                        <p><em>Zagare (2019)</em> argues that game theory provides a rigorous way to model historical crises. This simulation adopts that method. Each of the 10 missions is a "game" in the formal sense—a strategic interaction where the player must choose a move without knowing the opponent's full response. The player's decisions are moves in an <strong>Asymmetric Escalation Game</strong> or a <strong>Game of Chicken</strong>, much like those Zagare uses to analyze the Cuban Missile Crisis or the "Long Peace."</p>

                        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-300 mt-6 mb-3">3. The Four Metrics (The "Payoff" Structure)</h3>
                        <p>In Zagare's game-theoretic models, each choice has a "payoff." In this simulation, the payoffs are quantified by the four key metrics. Every decision is a trade-off, and the "payoff" is the change in these four variables, which represent the competing priorities of a national leader:</p>
                        <ul class="list-none space-y-4 mt-4 pl-4" style="list-style-type: none;">
                            <li class="relative pl-6">
                                <span class="absolute left-0 top-1.5 w-2 h-2 bg-blue-400 rounded-full"></span>
                                <strong>Public Trust:</strong> Represents the public's and media's confidence in your program. High trust is essential for securing funding and maintaining political support, but it is highly sensitive to perceived deception or failure.
                            </li>
                            <li class="relative pl-6">
                                <span class="absolute left-0 top-1.5 w-2 h-2 bg-blue-400 rounded-full"></span>
                                <strong>Budget:</strong> The financial resources available to your program. It is depleted by costly maneuvers and compensation, and can be increased through political victories or allied contributions.
                            </li>
                            <li class="relative pl-6">
                                <span class="absolute left-0 top-1.5 w-2 h-2 bg-blue-400 rounded-full"></span>
                                <strong>System Resilience:</strong> The technical and operational integrity of your space assets. This is increased by protecting secrets and neutralizing threats, but decreased by sharing technology, suffering breaches, or revealing capabilities.
                            </li>
                            <li class="relative pl-6">
                                <span class="absolute left-0 top-1.5 w-2 h-2 bg-blue-400 rounded-full"></span>
                                <strong>Diplomatic Stability:</strong> Represents the state of relations with other space-faring nations, including allies and rivals. It is improved through transparency and cooperation, but damaged by unilateral actions, deception, and aggressive posturing.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Each scenario in the simulation is a practical case study designed to test one or more of the core academic concepts. Here is how each mission connects the theory to the required decisions:</p>

                        <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold text-blue-300 mt-6 mb-2">Mission 1: The Argus-1 Launch</h4>
                        <p><strong>Concepts Applied:</strong> Vaynman & Volpe's Framework (Distinguishability).</p>
                        <p>This mission is a direct test of "distinguishability." The "Climate Research" cover story is an attempt to make a dual-use asset seem civilian (high distinguishability). The "Debris Monitor" is more honest but admits a military-adjacent function. The choice immediately impacts <strong>Diplomatic Stability</strong>, as rivals must guess your true intent in the "dead zone."</p>

                        <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold text-blue-300 mt-6 mb-2">Mission 2: Unidentified Object</h4>
                        <p><strong>Concepts Applied:</strong> Zagare's Game Theory (Risk & Caution).</p>
                        <p>A simple game of risk. Maneuvering (Caution) has a small, certain cost (<strong>Budget</strong>) but guarantees asset safety (<strong>System Resilience</strong>). "Pinging" the object is a gamble: it may reveal information, but as Vaynman & Volpe's work implies, it also risks revealing your capabilities (lowering <strong>System Resilience</strong>) by exposing your "digital signature."</p>

                        <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold text-blue-300 mt-6 mb-2">Mission 3: The Anomaly</h4>
                        <p><strong>Concepts Applied:</strong> Vaynman & Volpe (Integration).</p>
                        <p>This mission explores the "integration" problem. The flaw is not just a technical problem; it's a public relations one because the satellite is integrated with public life. Admitting the flaw (high <strong>Public Trust</strong>) risks exposing a vulnerability (low <strong>System Resilience</strong>). A media blackout is an attempt to hide the flaw, but it fails, proving that trust is a critical component of policy in the "dead zone."</p>

                        <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold text-blue-300 mt-6 mb-2">Mission 4: Allied Tech Request</h4>
                        <p><strong>Concepts Applied:</strong> Vaynman & Volpe (Distinguishability & Integration).</p>
                        <p>A classic "disclosure constraint." Sharing technology improves <strong>Diplomatic Stability</strong> and <strong>Budget</strong>, but it is an irreversible act of proliferation. Because the tech is indistinguishable and integrated, you have permanently reduced your <strong>System Resilience</strong> by giving away a core secret. This is the high-risk, high-reward nature of cooperation in the "dead zone."</p>

                        <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold text-blue-300 mt-6 mb-2">Mission 5: The 'Shadow'</h4>
                        <p><strong>Concepts Applied:</strong> Zagare's Asymmetric Escalation Game.</p>
                        <p>This is a "game of chicken," as analyzed by Zagare. A rival is escalating. Your choices are clear "moves": 1) Protest (de-escalate, lose face), 2) Deniable EW (match escalation, high risk), 3) "Dazzle" (aggressive escalation, high reward). The player must decide if protecting <strong>System Resilience</strong> is worth the severe <strong>Diplomatic Stability</strong> cost of "swerving" last.</p>

                        <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold text-blue-300 mt-6 mb-2">Mission 6: Budget Committee Threat</h4>
                        <p><strong>Concepts Applied:</strong> Vaynman & Volpe (Distinguishability).</p>
                        <p>This mission links <strong>Public Trust</strong> directly to <strong>Budget</strong>. To justify funding, you must choose between declassifying a minor capability (making it "distinguishable" as a public good) or holding firm. The PR win boosts <strong>Budget</strong> but, per Vaynman & Volpe, any disclosure (even minor) lowers <strong>System Resilience</strong> by revealing a piece of the puzzle.</p>

                        <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold text-blue-300 mt-6 mb-2">Mission 7: Debris Collision</h4>
                        <p><strong>Concepts Applied:</strong> Zagare's Game Theory (Payoff Structure).</p>
                        <p>This models a scenario with a "dominant
                        losing strategy." Attempting plausible deniability is designed to fail, demonstrating that in a game with perfect information (the public will find out), a failed cover-up has a worse payoff (catastrophic <strong>Public Trust</strong> loss) than simply taking the initial, costly hit to <strong>Budget</strong>.</p>

                        <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold text-blue-300 mt-6 mb-2">Mission 8: Ground Station Breach</h4>
                        <p><strong>Concepts Applied:</strong> Vaynman & Volpe (Integration).</p>
                        <p>This is the "integration" problem in action. The civilian and military networks are one. You must choose what to sacrifice: <strong>System Resilience</strong> (by not patching the vulnerability) or <strong>Public Trust</strong> (by patching it, but letting the data leak). It's a "no-win" scenario created by high integration, just as the paper predicts.</p>

                        <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold text-blue-300 mt-6 mb-2">Mission 9: Rival ASAT Test</h4>
                        <p><strong>Concepts Applied:</strong> Zagare's Perfect Deterrence Theory.</p>
                        <p>This models a major "red line" event that fundamentally changes the game's state. The rival's test has broken deterrence. Condemning the act is a diplomatic move that fails to solve the physical threat (<strong>System Resilience</strong> drops). Announcing your own ASAT program is a classic move in deterrence theory—re-establishing equilibrium through mutual threat, but at a catastrophic cost to <b>Diplomatic Stability</b> and <strong>Budget</strong>.</p>

                        <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold text-blue-300 mt-6 mb-2">Mission 10: Hostile Jamming</h4>
                        <p><strong>Concepts Applied:</strong> Vaynman & Volpe's "Dead Zone" & Zagare's Escalation.</p>
                        <p>The final "game." Faced with an act of war, the player must make their last move. The diplomatic option (sharing data) follows international norms but is a "loss." The military option ("activate counter-measure") proves Vaynman & Volpe's theory: the satellite was always an indistinguishable weapon. This act wins the immediate battle (high <strong>System Resilience</strong>) but proves the worst fears of rivals and the public, causing a total collapse in <strong>Diplomatic Stability</strong> and <strong>Public Trust</strong>—the exact "disaster" outcome that the "dead zone" framework predicts.</p>
                        
                        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-white border-b border-gray-700 pb-2 mt-12 mb-6">Design Philosophy</h2>
                        <p>The interface and feedback system of the Classified Mission Simulator were intentionally designed to reflect the aesthetics of bureaucratic control centers—minimalist, data-driven, and emotionally neutral. This design choice reinforces the project’s thematic intent: decisions made under secrecy appear rational and procedural, even when their long-term outcomes are destabilizing. The player’s experience of tension between clarity and opacity mirrors the institutional paradox at the core of modern state secrecy.</p>

                        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-white border-b border-gray-700 pb-2 mt-12 mb-6">Project Purpose</h2>
                        <p>The objective is not to "win" in a traditional sense, but to force the user to experience the consequences of their choices. The simulation uses Zagare's game-theoretic method to model the real-world policy dilemmas created by the "indistinguishable and integrated" technologies described by Vaynman & Volpe. By the end, the player experiences how a series of small, rational decisions can cascade into systemic instability—or how careful, balanced policy can navigate the "dead zone" of modern space governance.</p>

  <p>
    I built this simulator during my course SPS261 Government Secrecy and Intelligence Studies — a class about how power and information shape what the public is allowed to see. 
  </p>

  <h4>Why I Made This</h4>
  <p>
  When I watched Johnny Harris’s <a href="https://youtu.be/JZqa2wQdORo?si=xublioK0jSoxsrQL" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="video-link"><em>Space Wars</em></a> video, something clicked. The video wasn’t just about satellites — it was about how countries hide their intentions behind perfect public images. That tension between what’s visible and what’s true reminded me of our course discussions on secrecy and intelligence. I wanted to build something that lets people sit with that feeling, not just analyze it.
  </p>



  <h4>What I Learned</h4>
  <p>
    Building this showed me secrecy isn’t only about hiding — it’s about balancing risks, timing, and trust. Sometimes it protects. Sometimes it isolates. Most of the time, it’s both.
